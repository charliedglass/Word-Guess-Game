This game is a hangman for NBA teams!

You can start playing the game by pressing any of the letter keys (a-z).

You must guess what the word is within <b>7 guesses</b> (remember, each word will be an NBA team).  The game will show all the letters you've guessed already, and it will not penalize you for guessing the same letter more than once.  If you guess the team within 7 guesses, you win!  Your win total will go up 1, and the team's logo as well as a "You Win!" message will appear for 2 seconds before disappearing again.  If you can't guess the team name within 7 guesses, you lose.  The team's logo will appear with a "You Lose" message for 2 seconds.  After these 2 seconds, another team will be randomly selected, and you'll be able to play press any letter key and play again! 

(<b>Note: Guesses only go down if the letter you guessed is not in the word.  If it is, you will have the same number of guesses remaining.)

Start playing now, and see how many NBA teams you can guess correctly!
